# Node js chat app

I followed a tutorial to build this, but I've been practicing Node js more and I've concluded it's the best thing since the spawn of my existence, in the computer world at least.

# Future development

I do plan to keep working on this, and add a lot more features, perhaps a blockchain based chat. I'll focus on just Node / Express/ React for now.
